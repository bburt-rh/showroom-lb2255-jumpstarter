= About the Jumpstarter framework

== Overview

Jumpstarter is an open source framework that brings enterprise-grade testing
capabilities to everyone. While established industries like automotive and
manufacturing have long used HiL testing, these tools have typically been
expensive proprietary systems. Jumpstarter democratizes this technology through
a free, cloud native approach that works with both physical hardware and virtual
devices.

At its core, Jumpstarter uses a client/server architecture where a single client
can control multiple devices under test. Its modular design supports both local
development (devices connected directly to your machine) and distributed testing
environments (devices accessed remotely through a central controller). All
communication happens over gRPC, providing a consistent interface regardless of
deployment model.

Built on Python, Jumpstarter integrates easily with existing development
workflows and runs almost anywhere. It works with common testing tools like
https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/[pytest,window=_blank], shell scripts, Makefiles, and
typical CI/CD systems. Beyond testing, it can function as a virtual KVM
(Keyboard, Video, Mouse) switch, enabling remote access to physical devices for
development.

== Core components

Jumpstarter architecture is based on the following key components:

- **Device Under Test (DUT)** - Hardware or virtual device being tested
- **Drivers** - Interfaces for DUT communication
- **Adapters** - Convert driver connections into various formats
- **Exporters** - Expose device interfaces over network via gRPC
- **Clients** - Libraries and CLI tools for device interaction
- **Service** - Kubernetes controller for resource management

Component interactions include the following:

- **DUT and Drivers** - Drivers provide standardized interfaces to DUT's
  hardware connections.
- **Drivers and Adapters** - Adapters transform driver connections for
  specialized use cases.
- **Drivers/Adapters and Exporters** - Exporters manage drivers/adapters and
  expose them via gRPC.
- **Exporters and Clients** - Clients connect to exporters to control devices.
- **Clients/Exporters and Service** - Service manages access control and
  resource allocation in distributed mode.

Together, these components form a comprehensive testing framework that bridges
the gap between development and deployment environments.
