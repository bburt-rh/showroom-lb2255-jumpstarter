= Application Development

== Overview
In this module you will learn how to develop, build, and test a simple automotive application using Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces and OpenShift Pipelines.

The sample application is a simple `radio-service` that emulates a radio, regularly publishing information about the current track, the radio station, and volume level. 
The `radio-client` application connects to the radio service and requests to turn it on or off, to change the radio station, and adjust the volume.

It demonstrates how typical automotive applications use https://some-ip.com/[SOME/IP,window=_blank] to communicate. The application is written in C++ and uses the https://cmake.org/[CMake,window=_blank] build system.


[#appbuild]
== Build the application

In a first step, you will build and test the application inside Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces.

IMPORTANT: Click the *build* button at the bottom left of the window.

IMPORTANT: Choose to build with the GCC toolkit.

NOTE: The build process involves creating a "build" directory, and calling cmake to generate the Makefile. Then, make is called to compile the source code into multiple executable files.


[#apptest]
== Test the application

Once the application is built, you can test it.

IMPORTANT: Click the *triangular button* at the bottom left of the window to run the application. Choose to run *radio-service*.

Once the `radio-service` is running, you will see output like the following in the terminal:

[source,sh]
----
RADIO: Playing song "Upper Echelon" by Travi$ Scott feat. 2 Chainz & T.I. (on Radio Los Santos) 50% volume
----


Now start the `radio-client` to interact with the running `radio-service`. 

IMPORTANT: First, split the terminal by clicking the split button on the right middle of the screen.

You will see the terminal being split into two halves, with the `radio-service` running on the left, and a new shell to the right.

Start *radio-client* by clicking the right half of the terminal and type the following command, then press `Enter`.

[source,sh,role=execute]
----
./radio-client
----

In the `radio-client`, press 

- `+` or `-` to adjust the volume
- `<SPACE>` to switch stations
- `<ESC>` to pause or resume the radio. 

Observe the output in the `radio-service` terminal.

IMPORTANT: When done with testing, press `q` to quit the radio-client application.


[#appmodify]
== Modify the application 

Next, you will modify the application to add a new radio station and several new songs, and then repeat the build-test cycle.

IMPORTANT: Click `src` in the file explorer to open the src folder.

image::app/08-src.png[]

IMPORTANT: Click `radio-stations.cpp` to open the source file containing the radio stations and songs.

image::app/09-stations.png[]

IMPORTANT: At the top of the file, remove the two commented lines.

image::app/10-songs-before.png[]

IMPORTANT: Scroll down to the bottom of the file, remove the two commented lines.

After finishing editing, click into the `radio-service` terminal and enter `CTRL+C` to stop the running radio-service application.

Re-build and re-start the application by clicking the *triangular button* at the bottom left of the window, 
then re-start `radio-client` again on the right half of the terminal. 

TIP: Try switching stations by pressing `<SPACE>`, and find the newly added *Red Hat Summit Radio* station.

== Next

Now that you completed the "local" development workflow, you can explore some Jumpstarter capabilities including:

- Interacting with Jumpstarter Exporters from the command line
- Writing test cases for your application
- Flashing the application to a target device
