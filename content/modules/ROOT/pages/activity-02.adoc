= Application Development

== Overview
In this module we will learn how to develop, build, and test a simple automotive application using Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces.

The source repo contains a set of applications that demonstrate how typical automotive applications use SOME/IP communicate, 
these apps work both natively and in a container. For the purpose of this lab, we would be focusing on the `radio-service` application. 
This is a service that emulates a radio, regularly publishing information about the current track, station, and volume level. 
This service accepts requests to turn on/off, change channel, and adjust the volume over SOME/IP.

[#appbuild]
== Build the application

We can easily build, test, and publish our application using the cmake build system in our DevWorkspace.

IMPORTANT: Click the *build* button at the bottom left of the window.

image::app/01-kit.png[]

IMPORTANT: Choose to build with the GCC toolkit.

NOTE: The demo application is built using the *cmake* build system. The build process involves creating a "build" directory, and calling cmake to generate the Makefile,
then make will be called to compile the source code into multiple executable files. The cmake vscode plugin automatically detects the source code and
performs those steps on your behalf, but you can also do it manually if you want to.


[#apptest]
== Test the application

image::app/02-build-finish.png[]

IMPORTANT: After finishing building, *click the triangular button* at the bottom left of the window to run the application. Choose to run *radio-service*.

[TIP]
====
When the radio service is running, you will see log lines like

[source,sh]
----
RADIO: Playing song "Upper Echelon" by Travi$ Scott feat. 2 Chainz & T.I. (on Radio Los Santos) 50% volume
----

showing up in the terminal. 
====

Next, we can start the `radio-client` to interact with the running `radio-service`. 

IMPORTANT: First, split the terminal by clicking book like button on the right middle of the screen.

image::app/05-split.png[]

NOTE: You will see the terminal being split into two halves, with the `radio-service` running on the left, and a bash shell on the right.

image::app/06-run-client.png[]

IMPORTANT: Start *radio-client* by clicking the right half of the terminal and type the following command, then press `Enter`.

[source,sh,role=execute]
----
./radio-client
----

image::app/07-client-running.png[]

TIP: In the `radio-client`, press `+` or `-` to adjust the volume, `<SPACE>` to switch stations, and `<ESC>` to pause or resume the radio. 
Notice the changes in the printed status messages in response to your requests.

IMPORTANT: When done with testing, press `q` to quit the radio-client application.


[#appmodify]
== Modify the application 

Next, we will modify the application to add a new radio station and several new songs, and repeat the build-test cycle.

=== Modify the code

image::app/08-src.png[]

IMPORTANT: Click `src` in the file explorer to open the src folder.

image::app/09-stations.png[]

IMPORTANT: Click `radio-stations.cpp` to open the source file containing the radio stations and songs.

image::app/10-songs-before.png[]

IMPORTANT: At the top of the file, remove the two annotated lines.

image::app/11-songs-after.png[]

TIP: The remaining lines should look like this after editing.

image::app/12-stations-before.png[]

IMPORTANT: Scroll down to the bottom of the file, remove the two annotated lines.

image::app/13-stations-after.png[]

TIP: The remaining lines should look like this after editing.

=== Test modified code

[WARNING]
====
After finishing editing, click on the radio-service terminal and push `CTRL+C` to stop the execution, then
click the triangular button at the bottom left of the window to rerun `radio-service`, and
start `radio-client` again on the right half of the terminal. 
====

TIP: Try switching stations by pressing `<SPACE>`, and find the newly added *Red Hat Summit Radio* station.

== Next

Now that we've completed the "local" development workflow, we'll explore some Jumpstarter capabilities including:

- Interacting with Jumpstarter Exporters from the command line
- Writing custom test cases for your specific application requirements
- Flashing the application to a target device
