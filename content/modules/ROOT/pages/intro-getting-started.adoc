= Getting Started

[#devhub]
== Overview

Here is a quick overview of the first activities in this lab:

- Start your development workflow in the Red Hat Developer Hub portal
- Browse through the template catalog and select one tailored for automotive software development
- Create a new project from the template
- Launch your ready-to-code environment in Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces

Behind the scenes, Red Hat Developer Hub automatically structures your project and provides all the supporting infrastructure 
through OpenShift GitOps - so you can focus on coding, not setup.


== Access Red Hat Developer Hub

First you have to access the https://backstage-backstage.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}[Red Hat Developer Hub,window=_blank]. You can access the login page using this link:

https://backstage-backstage.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}[window=_blank]

Once authenticated, you have full access to the Red Hat Developer Hub portal where you can browse templates, create projects, and access your development environments.

The portal serves as your single point of entry for all automotive software development activities, providing access to templates, documentation, and your OpenShift Dev Spaces workspaces.


[#project]
== Project creation

Next, you will create a new project from a template.

IMPORTANT: Click the *Create* button on the side bar

[#workspace]
== Prepare the workspace

Once the Dev Workspace is created, you will be redirected to a *VS Code like* development environment.

IMPORTANT: If prompted "Do you trust the authors of the files in this workspace?", click *Yes, I trust the authors*

TIP: On the bottom right of the screen you may see some popup notifications, you can safely dismiss them.

You should see a familiar *VS Code* development environment in your browser. 


== Next

Now that you have set up your development environment, you are ready to start developing your application.
