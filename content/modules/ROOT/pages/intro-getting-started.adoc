= Getting Started

== Overview
Start your development workflow in the Red Hat Developer Hub portal:

- Browse through the template catalog and select one tailored for automotive software development
- Fill in your project's configuration details and initial parameters
- Launch your ready-to-code environment in Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces

Behind the scenes, Red Hat Developer Hub automatically structures your project and provides all the supporting infrastructure 
through OpenShift GitOps - so you can focus on coding, not setup.


== Conventions used in this lab

Some of the activities in this lab require you to perform certain actions in the various user interfaces or to type commands in a terminal window.
To highlight the different activities and their importance, we use the following conventions:

IMPORTANT: This is a step that is critical for the success of this lab.

== Tips for working with the lab environment

TIP: All login information is available via the side bar item, "Cheatsheet"

TIP: Clicking into a screen shot will enlarge it. Clicking it again will return it to its original size.

[#devhub]
== Access Red Hat Developer Hub

First, let's ensure we are logged into the *Red Hat Developer Hub*.

You can access the login page using this link:

IMPORTANT: Authorize Keycloak to access GitLab

Once authenticated, you'll have full access to the Red Hat Developer Hub portal where you can browse templates, create projects, and access your development environments.
The portal serves as your central starting point for all automotive software development activities, providing access to templates, documentation, and your OpenShift Dev Spaces workspaces.


[#project]
== Project creation

Next, we will create a pre-configured development environment using the Jumpstarter template provided for this lab.

IMPORTANT: On the dashboard, click *DevSpace jumpstarter-lab* to launch the Red Hat OpenShift Dev Space instance.


[#devspaces]
== Access Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces

As we did when accessing the Red Hat Developer Hub, we will need to log in to the Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces 
and authorize the application to access Red Hat OpenShift.

image::setup/09-log-in-devspace.png[]

IMPORTANT: Choose *Log in with OpenShift*

image::setup/10-login-devspace-rhsso.png[]

IMPORTANT: On the OpenShift login page, choose to login with *rhsso*.

You’ll be prompted to log in with your credentials:

.Username
[source,sh,role=copypaste,subs="+attributes"]

IMPORTANT: When asked to authorize access to your account, click *Allow selected permissions*

image::setup/13-devspace-create.png[]

IMPORTANT: When asked "Do you trust the author of this repository?", click *Continue*.

image::setup/14-devspace-gitlab-access.png[]

IMPORTANT: When asked to authorize *devspaces* to access your account on GitLab, click *Authorize devspaces*

image::setup/15-devspace-starting.png[]

NOTE: The creation of the *DevWorkspace* instance can take a few minutes, please be patient !


[#workspace]
== Prepare the workspace

Once the Dev Workspace is created, you will be redirected to a *VS Code like* development environment.

image::setup/17-devspace-trust.png[]

IMPORTANT: If prompted "Do you trust the authors of the files in this workspace?", click *Yes, I trust the authors*

image::setup/18-devspace-popup.png[]

TIP: On the bottom right of the screen you may see some popup notifications, you can safely dismiss them.

Now you should see a familiar *VS Code* development environment in your browser. 
Take a moment to explore the created development environment, it should contain everything you need to complete this lab.


== Next

Now that we have our development environment set up, we can start developing our application.
