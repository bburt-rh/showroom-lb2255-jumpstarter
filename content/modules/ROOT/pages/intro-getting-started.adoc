= Getting Started

== Overview
Start your project in the Red Hat Developer Hub portal:

- Browse through the template catalog and select one tailored for automotive software development
- Fill in your project's configuration details and initial parameters
- Launch your ready-to-code environment in Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces

Behind the scenes, Red Hat Developer Hub automatically structures your project and provisions all supporting infrastructure through OpenShift GitOps - letting you focus on coding, not setup.

[#devhub]
== Access Red Hat Developer Hub

First, let's ensure we are logged into the *Red Hat Developer Hub*.

WARNING: Authorize Keycloak to access GitLab

Once authenticated, you'll have full access to the Red Hat Developer Hub portal where you can browse templates, create projects, and access your development environments.
The portal serves as your central starting point for all automotive software development activities, providing access to templates, documentation, and your OpenShift Dev Spaces workspaces.


[#project]
== Project creation

Next, we will create a pre-configured development environment using the Jumpstarter template provided for this lab.

and authorize the application to access Red Hat OpenShift.

NOTE: The creation of the *DevWorkspace* instance can take a few minutes, please be patient !


[#workspace]
== Prepare the workspace

Once the Dev Workspace is created, you will be redirected to a *VS Code like* development environment.

TIP: On the bottom right of the screen is a popup asking to reload Visual Studio Code, click *Reload Now*, if you missed the popup, refresh the page by pressing `F5`.

Now you should see a familiar *VS Code* development environment in your browser. 
Take a moment to explore the created development environment, it should contain everything you need to complete this lab.


== Next

Now that we have our development environment set up, we can start developing our application.
