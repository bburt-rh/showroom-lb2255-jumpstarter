= Working with Jumpstarter

Not only can Jumpstarter help automate hardware testing in CI pipelines, but as your project grows, Jumpstarter's remote access capabilities
allows your team to share limited hardware devices across geographically dispersed teams in a secure, controlled and efficient manner.

Jumpstarter manages remote access to Exporters using **Leases**, which give a client access to an Exporter, for a specified period of time. 

When a Lease is created, the Jumpstarter Service attempts to find a matching Exporter using a label selector. Once a Lease has been acquired,
the client can start a session within that Lease to access the hardware remotely.

NOTE: Your Dev Space is already configured with credentials to access a Jumpstarter Service running on the same cluster, with multiple Exporters available for lease.

== List the Exporters

IMPORTANT: First let's create a terminal window by clicking the *+* button.

image::app/new-terminal.png[]

The following commands should be executed in this newly created terminal. To list the available Exporters, run:

[source,sh,role=execute]
----
jmp get exporters
----

Each exporter can be configured with a set of labels that can be used to select a particular group of Exporters when requesting a lease.
For example, Exporters can be configured with a label named `arch` that indicates their architecture, and then you can select 
a device of a particular architecture by using this label, e.g. `arch=aarch64`.

[#jmpexporterlease]
== Leases and remote Exporters

A Lease is a way to access an Exporter. To select an Exporter of `type=virtual` and create a Lease, run the following command:

[source,sh,role=execute]
----
jmp shell --selector type=virtual
----

The command uses the default config file located at `~/.config/jumpstarter/clients/lab.yaml`. 

The default client uses the `--selector` parameter to find an Exporter that matches the label `type=virtual`.

TIP: Notice that your shell prompt changed to `jumpstarter ⚡remote ➤`. This is to remind you that you are inside a remote Jumpstarter shell session.

When you lease an Exporter, you get exclusive access to the hardware interfaces connected to the Exporter for the duration of the lease.

To see the list of hardware interfaces exposed on the Exporter you have leased, run the `j` command without parameters:

[source,sh,role=execute]
----
j
----

You should see an output like this:

[source,sh]
----
Usage: j [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  Generic composite device

Options:
  --help  Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  console  Serial port client
  flasher  Generic flasher interface
  power    Generic power
  qemu     Generic composite device
----

As the remote Exporter is connected to a `virtual QEMU device`, you can use the above subcommands to interact with the device: 

- control the power with the `power` subcommand
- flash a new image with the `flasher` command
- access the serial console with `console`

A physical device with a similar interface could be interacted with in the same way.

'''
=== First boot

Before booting your virtual device, you have to flash it with an operating system image:

[source,sh,role=execute]
----
./scripts/flash-prebuilt
----

NOTE: The script flashes a prebuilt RHIVOS image to the virtual device. You will build a custom image in a later exercise.

After flashing, you can boot the device and view the boot messages via the serial console:

[source,sh,role=execute]
----
j power on && j console start-console
----

Once the image has finished booting, you will be presented with a login prompt. Login with the following credentials:

.Username
[.no-copy-label]
[source,text,role=execute,subs=attributes+]
----
root
----

.Password
[.no-copy-label]
[source,text,role=execute,subs=attributes+]
----
password
----

TIP: Your shell prompt will changed to `[root@localhost ~]`. This is to remind you that you are inside the serial console of the virtual device.

After logging into the system, you can check the system architecture using `uname`:

[source,sh,role=execute]
----
uname -m
----

It should print `aarch64`, meaning that this is a ARM based virtual device.

IMPORTANT: Quit the serial console by *pressing `Ctrl+B` three times*.

Your shell prompt will be restored to `jumpstarter ⚡remote ➤`.

'''
=== Port forwarding and remote access

Sometimes your tests cannot be executed directly on the target device or the Exporter host.
To support these use cases, Jumpstarter implements port forwarding, which allows you to interact 
with services running on the target device from your local machine.

To forward a remote service port such as the `ssh` to a local port, run the following command:

[source,sh,role=execute]
----
j qemu ssh forward-tcp 9000 &
----

This command will forward the remote `ssh` port (port 22) preconfigured in the exporter config to `localhost:9000` on your local machine. 

Once port forwarding is started, you can run an `ssh` client from your local environment and execute commands on the 
virtual device remotely, e.g. check cpu info:

[source,sh,role=execute]
----
ssh -p 9000 -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no  \
  -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null \
  root@localhost cat /proc/cpuinfo
----

When prompted for a password, enter:

.Password
[.no-copy-label]
[source,text,role=execute,subs=attributes+]
----
password
----


[#jmptestingpytest]
== Testing with Pytest

While remotely connecting to a Jumpstarter Exporter to run tests is a huge step forward from traditional 
methods of hardware testing, we can further improve our test procedures to be automated, repeatable, and reliable.

You can use any testing framework with Jumpstarter, not only *Pytest*, but we recommend it due to its simplicity and popularity.

=== Writing tests

An example pytest script, that uses the Jumpstarter API looks like this:

.test/test_on_hardware.py
[source,python]
----
import logging
import sys

import pytest

from jumpstarter_testing.pytest import JumpstarterTest


log = logging.getLogger(__name__)


class TestRHIVOSOnHardware(JumpstarterTest):
    selector = "type=virtual"

    def test_boot(self, client):
        """Test the boot process of the device."""
        log.info("Testing boot process")
        client.power.cycle()
        with client.console.pexpect() as console:
            # uncomment this if you want to see the console in action while testing
            # console.logfile_read = sys.stdout.buffer
            console.expect_exact("login:", timeout=120)
            console.sendline("root")
            console.expect_exact("Password:", timeout=10)
            console.sendline("password")
            console.expect_exact("]#", timeout=10)
    def test_uname(self, client):
        with client.console.pexpect() as console:
            console.sendline("uname -a")
            console.expect_exact("]#", timeout=10)
            print(console.before.decode())
----

Let's explore the script line by line.

.import
[source,python]
----
import logging
import sys

import pytest

from jumpstarter_testing.pytest import JumpstarterTest
----

The first part of the script imports standard Python packages, as well as
`pytest` and the `JumpstarterTest` helper from the `jumpstarter_testing` packages.


.setup
[source,python]
----
class TestRHIVOSOnHardware(JumpstarterTest):
    selector = "type=virtual"
----

The actual test happens in class `TestRHIVOSOnHardware`, which is a subclass of `JumpstarterTest`.
The `JumpstarterTest` class provides the required logics for connecting to an Exporter.
To select which Exporter and device the test should run on, the `selector` class variable is used.


.test-boot
[source,python]
----
    def test_boot(self, client):
        """Test the boot process of the device."""
        log.info("Testing boot process")
        client.power.cycle()
        with client.console.pexpect() as console:
            # uncomment this if you want to see the console in action while testing
            # console.logfile_read = sys.stdout.buffer
            console.expect_exact("login:", timeout=120)
            console.sendline("root")
            console.expect_exact("Password:", timeout=10)
            console.sendline("password")
            console.expect_exact("]#", timeout=10)
----

This is the first test case, which tests the boot process of the device.

It first cycles the power of the device, then it connects to the console and waits for
the login prompt, then sends the username and password to log in to the device.

After logging in, it waits for the shell prompt to show up, indicating that the login
was successful.

.test-uname
[source,python]
----
    def test_uname(self, client):
        with client.console.pexpect() as console:
            console.sendline("uname -a")
            console.expect_exact("]#", timeout=10)
            print(console.before.decode())
----

The second test case sends the `uname -a` command to the console and
waits for the shell prompt to show up, then prints the output of the command.

NOTE: The above test is basically the same steps you performed in the previous section "First boot".

'''
=== Running tests

Now you can run the test script using pytest. The test scripts are located in the `tests` directory of the project.

image::act4/test-sources.png[]

You should still be in the remote Jumpstarter shell session:

[,console]
----
jumpstarter ⚡remote ➤
----

TIP: If you are *NOT* inside the remote Jumpstarter shell session, run `jmp shell --selector type=virtual` to lease a new Exporter. Then run the `./scripts/flash-prebuilt` to flash the device again.

Run the test script using pytest:

[source,sh,role=execute]
----
pytest
----

You should see the test results:

[,console]

You will notice that some of the tests are skipped, this is because we have not built our RHIVOS image yet. This will be covered in the next section.
