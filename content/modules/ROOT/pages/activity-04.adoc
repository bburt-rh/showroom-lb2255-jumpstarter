= Testing and Validation

== Overview

While Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces provides a consistent environment for developing, building, and testing automotive applications, comprehensive validation 
requires testing on virtual or physical hardware. This additional testing ensures:

- System stability
- Performance optimization
- Compatibility across target platforms

Before building a production-ready RHIVOS image, you must verify that your application functions correctly in a cloud environment. 
After that, you can build a RHIVOS image with the modified application embedded, preparing it for end-to-end testing in
virtualized hardware environments using Jumpstarter.

NOTE: This activity builds upon the previous activity, where you modified the application code.

[#test-app]
== Enable tests of the app

Before committing your changes to the source code repository, you need to enable some test cases 
that will be run against the application later in the pipeline.

IMPORTANT: Open `tests/test_on_hardware.py` and remove the three code annotations.

The code should look like this when you are done:

image::app/14-enable-test-done.png[]

Before removing the code annotations, the test cases only covered the RHIVOS image, verifying that it is booting correctly.
The additional test cases test the radio application itself.

The first test is to check if the container image of the apps is present:

[source,python]
----
    def test_podman_images(self, client):
        with client.console.pexpect() as console:
            console.sendline("podman images")
            console.expect_exact("]#", timeout=10)
            assert "localhost/app" in console.before.decode()
----

The second test is to check if the radio app is running as a system service:

[source,python]
----
    def test_radio_service(self, client):
        with client.console.pexpect() as console:
            console.sendline("systemctl status --no-pager radio.service")
            console.expect_exact("]#", timeout=10)
----

The third test is to interact with the radio service, and see if it can change the volume.

[source,python]
----
    def test_radio_service_interaction(self, client):
        with client.console.pexpect() as console:
            console.sendline("podman exec -i systemd-radio radio-client")
            console.expect_exact("Connecting to radio service", timeout=10)

            # test changing volume
            console.sendline("+" * 10)
            console.expect_exact("Volume:  [#####################]", timeout=10)
            console.sendline("-" * 10)
            console.expect_exact("Volume:  [                     ]", timeout=10)
            console.sendline("+" * 5)
            console.expect_exact("Volume:  [##########           ]", timeout=10)

            console.sendline("q")
            console.expect_exact("]#", timeout=10)
----

[#container]
== Container image build

Now that all the changes are done, you can commit the changes to the source code repository.

You will first need to create a new branch and commit the changes. Then, you will create a *pull request* against the *main* branch.

IMPORTANT: Open the branch selector menu by clicking the *main* button in the status bar footer at the bottom left of the screen.

image::app/14-branch.png[]

IMPORTANT: In the input box, enter *develop*. Then, select *Create new branch*.

image::app/15-branch-create.png[]

WARNING: Make sure the button on the bottom left of the screen now says *develop*, the name of the newly created branch.

IMPORTANT: Click the *Source Control* button in the left sidebar to open the source control tab.

image::app/16-branch-created.png[]

IMPORTANT: In the input box, put `"add new radio station"` as the commit message, then click *Commit*.

image::app/17-commit.png[]

IMPORTANT: Click the *Publish Branch* button to push the new changes to the code repository.

image::app/18-push.png[]

After the changes are pushed to the code repository, a Red Hat OpenShift Pipelines pipeline run is triggered. This run builds the application and creates a new container image.

To check the progress of the pipeline, switch to the
https://backstage-backstage.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/catalog/default/component/{user}-jumpstarter-lab/ci[Red Hat Developer Hub dashboard,window=_blank].

The resulting container image is pushed to the enterprise container registry, https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/quay[Red Hat Quay].

It is also deployed to its own namespace on the OpenShift cluster. As a developer, you could now do further testing or debugging, without having to rebuild the RHIVOS image.


[#merge]
== Create a Merge Request

Now that you have a container image, you can start the process of building the RHIVOS image. 

The build process is triggered by creating a *"Merge Request"* in GitLab. Merge requests are a great way to propose changes to the codebase. They allow for code reviews, discussion on changes 
and automated testing before merging changes into the main branch.

Switch to the https://backstage-backstage.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/catalog/default/component/{user}-jumpstarter-lab/[Red Hat Developer Hub dashboard,window=_blank] and click on the *View source* button to navigate to the GitLab interface.

image::act3/01-go-to-gitlab.png[]

IMPORTANT: In GitLab, select the `develop` branch and click on the *New* button,

image::act3/02-create-mr.png[]

IMPORTANT: To create a merge request, click on the *Create Merge Request* button

image::act3/03-create-mr-2.png[]

Creating a merge request triggers a pipeline that builds and tests the RHIVOS image. It is defined in `.tekton/tasks/pr-build-test.yaml`. 
You can see the pipeline running in the GitLab interface.

If you switch back to the https://backstage-backstage.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/catalog/default/component/{user}-jumpstarter-lab/ci[Red Hat Developer Hub dashboard,window=_blank], you can also see the pipeline running there.

image::act3/06-pipeline-details.png[]

Looking at the pipeline in detail, it performs the following tasks:

- `fetch-repository`: Clones the repository and checks out the *develop* branch.
- `prepare-jumpstarter-config`: Prepares the Jumpstarter configuration files for authenticating to the Jumpstarter service.
- `build-container`: Builds and pushes the container image with your application.
- `tag-container`: Tags the container image as *latest*.
- `prepare-build`: Configures the automotive image builder, based on the *.aib-ci.yaml* configuration file.
- `automotive-image-builder`: Builds the RHIVOS image using the *automotive-image-builder* tool, which is a part of the Red Hat In-Vehicle OS (RHIVOS) project.
- `create-jumpstarter-lease`: Requests and waits for a Jumpstarter exporter lease. The leased device (or virtual device) will be used for testing in the following tasks.
- `flash-with-jumpstarter`: Flashes the RHIVOS image to the leased device.
- `test-with-jumpstarter`: Runs the defined test cases in the *tests* directory of the project.
- `release`: Ends the lease and releases the device back to pool of available devices.
- `s3-upload`: Uploads the RHIVOS image to an *S3 bucket* for interactive use.

Once the pipeline is finished, you can see the results reported back to GitLab:

[#release]
== Release deployment pipeline

Once the test pipeline has finished, you can start the release workflow, assuming that all the tests have passed.

To start the release workflow, you must merge the changes on the *develop* branch into the *main* branch. 
This triggers the release pipeline, which is defined in `.tekton/tasks/pr-build-release.yaml`. 

The release pipeline is similar to the test pipeline, but it focuses on releasing the OS image to actual hardware:

- Builds the production-ready RHIVOS image optimized for a specific hardware platform (see NOTES below)
- Uses Jumpstarter to flash the image directly to the physical hardware
- Uses Jumpstarter to run the defined test cases on the physical hardware

NOTE: The release pipeline focuses on hardware testing rather than virtual testing, assuming all validation has been completed in the development pipeline. 

TIP: A good alternative is to always use physical devices on merge requests if your lab has sufficient resources. This way you can validate the code on hardware before merging it to the main branch.

NOTE: Due to the limited availability of physical hardware in this lab, we will only show this on screen.

Merging into *main* can be done by clicking on the *Merge* button in the merge request page:

Now that you completed the development workflow, letâ€™s recap what you have learned.
