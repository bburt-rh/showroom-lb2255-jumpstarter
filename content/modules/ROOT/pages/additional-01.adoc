= Configuring Jumpstarter Exporter

At the core of Jumpstarter is the *Exporter*, a program that exposes *hardware interfaces* on your *Device Under Test (DUT)* to a local or remote *Client*. Exporter typically run on a "host" system directly connected to your hardware through various test harnesses (think USB to UART adapters or JTAG connectors).

Exporters use *Drivers* to abstract *hardware interfaces* into *software interfaces*, providing a unified abstraction for controlling your hardware. Drivers are written in *Python* to make use of the vast ecosystem of existing Python packages. While Jumpstarter comes with Drivers for many basic interfaces, custom Drivers can also be developed for specialized hardware/interfaces or to provide domain-specific abstractions for your use case.

== List Available Drivers
To list the Drivers available in your Jumpstarter installation, run the following command:

[source,sh,role=execute]
----
jmp driver list
----

[TIP]
====
Some driver packages provide mock drivers, usually with a `Mock` prefix. While mock drivers do not provide access to physical or virtual hardware, they are useful for testing or demonstration.
====

== Writing an Exporter Config

Exporters can be configured with a YAML config file. Jumpstarter uses a Kubernetes-style YAML syntax for writing configs.

.header
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: jumpstarter.dev/v1alpha1
kind: ExporterConfig
----

The first section is the header. This denotes the Jumpstarter API version (`apiVersion`) and type (`kind`) of config. This allows for backwards-compatibility with future versions of Jumpstarter.

.metadata
[source,yaml]
----
metadata:
  namespace: default
  name: demo
----

The second section is the `metadata`. This section provides information about the `name` and `namespace` of the Exporter. Jumpstarter uses these to correlate the local config file with resources in the cluster.

[TIP]
====
The exporter `namespace` can be used to divide exporters into different groups. For example, the namespace `jumpstarter-lab01` could contain all exporters within a specific lab.
====

.connection info
[source,yaml]
----
endpoint: ""
token: ""
----

The third section is the connection info. This provides an `endpoint` and authentication `token` to connect to the Jumpstarter Service for remote access. Since we will only be using this Exporter for local access, these fields can be left empty.

.export
[source,yaml]
----
export:
  power:
    # provides power management: power on/off/cycle
    type: jumpstarter_driver_power.driver.MockPower
  console:
    # provides serial console access
    type: jumpstarter_driver_pyserial.driver.PySerial
    config:
      url: "loop://"
  flasher:
    # provides storage access: like flashing a disk image into a sdcard
    type: jumpstarter_driver_opendal.driver.MockFlasher
----

The last and most important section is `export`. This dictionary field contains a tree of Drivers to be exported to the Client. We use this section to specify the "shape" of our test harness that clients will see.

In the example above we've configured three Drivers, `power`, `console` and `flasher`. These keys are used as aliases for the driver instances attached to our Exporter.

Drivers classes are specified using the fully-qualified Python type in the `type` field. Driver-specific configurations can be passed through the `config` field. In this example, we configured the `PySerial` Driver to connect to the `loop://` serial port, which is a virtual serial port that echos everything sent to it.

To see what config options are available on each Driver, check https://docs.jumpstarter.dev/main/api-reference/drivers/index.html[Jumpstarter Driver API Reference]


WARNING: create a new file `demo-exporter-yaml` in the root directory of the project, with the following content.

.demo-exporter.yaml
[source,yaml,role=copypaste]
----
apiVersion: jumpstarter.dev/v1alpha1
kind: ExporterConfig
metadata:
  namespace: default
  name: demo
endpoint: ""
token: ""
export:
  power:
    # provides power management: power on/off/cycle
    type: jumpstarter_driver_power.driver.MockPower
  console:
    # provides serial console access
    type: jumpstarter_driver_pyserial.driver.PySerial
    config:
      url: "loop://"
  flasher:
    # provides storage access: like flashing a disk image into a sdcard
    type: jumpstarter_driver_opendal.driver.MockFlasher
----

== Running Jumpstarter Exporter For Local Access

In the last section, we've already configured our *Exporter* with various *Drivers*, we can now run it and interact with the *Drivers* with Jumpstarter *Client*. To start the exporter for local access, run the follow command:

[source,sh,role=execute]
----
jmp shell --exporter-config ./demo-exporter.yaml
----

TIP: Notice that your shell prompt have been changed to `jumpstarter ⚡local ➤`, this is to remind you that you are inside a local Jumpstarter shell session.

Inside a Jumpstarter shell session, the environment variable `$JUMPSTARTER_HOST` is set, pointing to a unix domain socket which the Exporter is listening on. Jumpstarter *Client* would read this environment variable, connect to the *Exporter*, and send requests to control the hardware interfaces, e.g. turning the power switch on.

[source,sh,role=execute]
----
echo $JUMPSTARTER_HOST
----

=== Using The j Command

The most straightforward way to interact with Jumpstarter Exporters is to use the magic `j` command. The `j` command is only available in a Jumpstarter shell session, and it is dynamically constructed reflecting the tree of Drivers configured on the currently connected Exporter. Not all Drivers have corresponding command line interfaces, those without would not be visible under the `j` command.

Run the `j` command without any arguments to see its usage:

[source,sh,role=execute]
----
j
----

With the exporter config defined in `exporter-demo.yaml`, we should see an output like this:

[source,sh]
----
Usage: j [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  Generic composite device

Options:
  --help  Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  console  Serial port client
  flasher  Generic flasher interface
  power    Generic power
----

TIP: The name of the subcommands matches the name we gave to the Drivers in the Exporter config

Run `j power` command to see its usage:

[source,sh,role=execute]
----
j power
----

With the `MockPower` Driver, we should see an output like this:

[source,sh]
----
Usage: j power [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  Generic power

Options:
  --help  Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  cycle  Power cycle
  off    Power off
  on     Power on
----

This means the `MockPower` Driver provides three methods, power on, power off, or power cycle the device under test.

Try turning the power of the device under test on and off

[source,sh,role=execute]
----
j power on
j power off
----

TIP: Nothing actually happens because we are using a mock power driver, but have we configured it with a real power driver, e.g. a USB power relay, you would see the device under test being turned on and off.

=== Using The Python API (Optional)

Another way to interact with Jumpstarter Exporters is to use the Jumpstarter Python API. Jumpstarter Python API is more powerful than the `j` command as it offers the full functionalities of the Drivers but is also harder to use.

To use the Python API, let's write a simple Python script:

.power-control.py
[source,python,role=copypatste]
----
from jumpstarter.common.utils import env

with env() as dut:
    dut.power.on()
    dut.power.off()
----

The `env` helper method reads the `$JUMPSTARTER_HOST` environment variable, connects to the Exporters, asks the Exporter for a list of all the configured Drivers, and then constructs a magic object mirroring the tree of Drivers. And then you can call the methods on the magic object to control the hardware interfaces, just as what we've done with the `j` command. To see what methods are available in the Python API of each Driver, check https://docs.jumpstarter.dev/main/api-reference/drivers/index.html[Jumpstarter Driver API Reference]

[source,sh,role=execute]
----
python power-control.py
----
