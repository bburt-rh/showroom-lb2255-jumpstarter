= Testing and Validation

While Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces provides a consistent environment for developing, building, and testing automotive applications,
comprehensive validation requires testing on virtual or physical hardware to ensure stability, performance, and compatibility across target platforms.

== Overview
In this activity, we will build a RHIVOS image with our application embedded, preparing it for end-to-end testing in
virtualized hardware environments using Jumpstarter, by:

- Taking the `develop` branch that we created in the previous activity, and propose a merge request to the `main` branch.
- Understanding how the pipelines build the RHIVOS image and perform testing with Jumpstarter in virtual hardware.

== Create a Merge Request

Create a merge request to merge your changes from the `⁠develop` branch into the ⁠main branch. To perform this
we should go to the gitlab interface and select the `develop` branch. Click on the *Merge Request* button to create a new merge request.

We can get to the GitLab interface by clicking on the View source of our component in the Red Hat Developer Hub dashboard:

https://backstage-backstage.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/catalog/default/component/{user}-jumpstarter-lab[window=_blank]

once there, click on the *View source* link:

Once in the GitLab interface, we should select the `develop` branch and click on the *Merge Request* button,

Merge requests are a way to propose changes to the codebase. They allow for code review, discussion, and **automated testing** before merging changes into the main branch,
let's create it by clicking on the *Create Merge Request* button:

By creating a merge request a different pipeline will be triggered, in this case, the one contained in `.tekton/tasks/pr-build-test.yaml`.

If we go to the CI tab in our component in backstage, or just the links in the GitLab merge request comments we can see the pipelines running:

Looking in detail, this pipeline performs the following steps, some in parallel:

- `fetch-repository`: Clones the repository and checks out the *develop* branch from our merge request.
- `prepare-jumpstarter-config`: Prepares the Jumpstarter configuration files for authenticating to the Jumpstarter service.
- `build-container`: Builds and pushes the container image for our application using the *Containerfile* located in the *src* directory.
- `tag-container`: Tags the container image as *latest*.
- `prepare-build`: Validates the RHIVOS automotime image builder definition in *.aib-ci.yaml* and prepares the build environment.
- `automotive-image-builder`: Builds the RHIVOS image using the *automotive-image-builder tool*, which is a part of the Red Hat In-Vehicle OS (RHIVOS) project.
- `create-jumpstarter-lease`: Requests and waits for a Jumpstarter exporter lease, the leased device (or virtual device) will be used for testing in the following tasks.
- `flash-with-jumpstarter`: Flashes the RHIVOS image to the leased device using Jumpstarter.
- `test-with-jumpstarter`: Runs the defined test cases in the *tests* directory of our project on the flashed device.
- `release`: Finishes the lease and releases the device back to Jumpstarter.
- `s3-upload`: Uploads the built image to an *S3 bucket* for interactive, we will use this on the next.


Once the pipeline is finished, we can see the results reported back to GitLab.

== Release deployment pipeline

Once everything went well, we can merge the merge-request to main, this will trigger the *release* pipeline, which is defined in `.tekton/tasks/pr-build-release.yaml`.

- Builds the production-ready RHIVOS image optimized for your specific hardware platform (see NOTEs below)
- Uses Jumpstarter to flash the image directly to the physical hardware
- Uses Jumpstarter to run the defined test cases on the physical hardware

NOTE: The release pipeline focuses on hardware testing rather than virtual testing, assuming all validation has been completed in the development pipeline. *An good alternative* is to always use physical devices on merge requests if your lab has sufficient resources,
      this way you can validate the code on hardware before merging it to the main branch.

NOTE: Due to the limited availability of physical hardware in this lab, we will only show this on screen, but the participant pipelines will still test on virtual hardware.

Merging into main can be done by clicking on the *Merge* button in the merge request page:

== Next

Now that we've completed the development workflow, we'll explore advanced Jumpstarter capabilities including:

- Manual interaction with hardware for development and troubleshooting
- Writing custom test cases for your specific application requirements
