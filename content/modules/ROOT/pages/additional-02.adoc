= Development Workflow

This section outlines the comprehensive workflow for automotive software development, from initial project creation through testing and validation on target platforms.

[#project_creation]
== Project creation

Begin your development journey in the Red Hat Developer Hub portal:

- Browse and select an appropriate software template for your automotive application
- Provide necessary configuration parameters and initial setup information

The platform automatically creates your project structure and provisions all supporting infrastructure through OpenShift GitOps.

[#application_development]
== Application development

Use Red Hat DevSpaces as your integrated development environment:

- Write, edit, and refine your automotive software code in the browser-based IDE
- Run preliminary tests directly within the Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces environment

Validate basic functionality before proceeding to formal testing phases.

NOTE: This is covered in xref:activity-02.adoc[Activity 2].

[#application_testing]
== Application testing

Push your code to the local source code repository (GitLab):

- Code commits automatically trigger the configured CI/CD build pipelines
- Built artifacts (RPM packages, containers, OS images) are being generated
- Leverage cloud infrastructure for integration testing

This phase helps verify component interactions before advancing to virtual or HIL testing.

[#application_validation]
== Application validation

Start the formal process of application validation by creating a pull request (PR):

- Execute virtual testing using VMs/QEMU to simulate target environments
- Conduct interactive testing using Jumpstarter to directly interact with the application
- Perform advanced SIL testing with virtualized and simulated hardware platforms (e.g. Corellium)
- Verify that all requirements are met in the actual runtime environment

NOTE: Using a simulated hardware platform like Corellium is not part of this lab!

Create a new release and merge the PR into the main branch to finalize the validation process:

- Deploy and validate the application on the target platform using Jumpstarter
